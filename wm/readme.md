# My nwm config
This is the config of nrn, somewhat modified from the original mixu config and starting to include my own other config files.
If you stumbled on this not knowing what is going on, please go to http://github.com/mixu/nwm-user.

Customizations:

- My default layout is switched based on the number of windows on screen:
    1 window = fullscreen
    2 windows = DWM's tiling
    3 windows = DWM's tiling
    4 windows = Fair grid
    5 = tile, 6 = grid
    ... and so on
- I have 19 workspaces per screen (Meta + F1 .. F9 are mapped to another 9 workspaces).
- Meta + Left / Meta + Right and Meta + PgDown / Meta + PgUp switch between workspaces (up / down)

Todo / experiments todo:

- Full screen detection / flash support
- Write a more tmux-style grid layout (e.g. adaptive slicing)
- Add support for "execute or find by window class" keyboard shortcuts (e.g. for chrome and pcmanfm)
- Add support for permanent window decoration, like Conky or another panel
- Add support for desktop widgets
- Start window always on a particular screen
    - This would probably benefit from a HTTP interface to configure and examine nwm
- Write a light compositing desktop background updater
    -  Would make it possible to do cool composited things like taking a time and overlaying another mask like in http://www.flickr.com/photos/haiiro/5356014236/
- Media key bindings (JS, to nplay):
    - Win + Z X C V B



## Installing

    # NWM
    git clone git://github.com/mixu/nwm.git
    cd nwm
    node-waf clean || true && node-waf configure build
    sudo npm link # add a global npm symlink to this repository - so nwm-user can find it (man npm link)
    
    # NWM-user
    cd ..
    git clone git://github.com/mixu/nwm-user.git
    cd nwm-user
    npm link nwm # now make a symlink to the nwm installation

And then do whatever is needed to make your login manager start nwm-user.js

## Keyboard shortcuts

As a long time dwm user, I'm used to the following keyboard shortcuts:

    # Launching programs
    Meta + Shift + Enter -- Start xterm

    # Layouts
    Meta + space -- Alternates between layouts

    # Focus
    Meta + j -- Focus next window
    Meta + k -- Focus previous window

    # Main window
    Meta + h -- Decrease master area size
    Meta + F10
    Meta + l -- Increase master area size
    Meta + F11
    Meta + Tab -- Sets currently focused window as main window

    # Closing window
    Meta + Shift + c -- Close focused window

    # Workspaces
    Meta + [1..n] -- Switch to workspace n
    Meta + Shift + [1..n] -- Move window to workspace n


    # Multi-monitor keys
    Meta + Shift + , -- Send focused window to previous screen
    Meta + Shift + . -- Send focused window to next screen
